** Make a project skeleton **
*Technical stack:*

- Gulp
- Sass/Compass
- Backbone/Marionette
- Handlebar
- Haml


*Tips/note
> npm install gulp --save-dev //use --save-dev to install and add the dependency into json file


*Questions:
- When after npm install, both backbone and backbone.marionette each have underscore as it sub node modules. Does this cause problem, or does this cause redundance?
